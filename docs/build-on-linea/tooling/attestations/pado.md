## PADO

[PADO](https://padolabs.org) is a cryptography-based attestation protocol to bring all Internet data into smart contracts. PADO relies heavily on cryptography to minimize trust, and enables end users to prove the correctness of their personal web data in a privacy-preserving manner. 

The core techniques used in PADO include secure multi-party computation (MPC) and interactive zero-knowledge proofs (IZK). End users run PADO client apps to attest their personal web data, and create related data proofs with the help of PADO nodes. These data proofs are cryptographically verified attestations with security guarantees including:
* Data authenticity: the user web data is honestly retrieved from the indicated data source, and the integrity is secured by MPC-TLS and IZK techniques.
* Privacy: When coupled with specific application logic, users' sensitive information is well protected under the zero-knowledge property.
  
The MPC-TLS and IZK techniques are general enough for both data source integration and data computation. For instance, one can create his/her own attestations including but not limited to:
* Proofs of CEX assets, e.g., Alice has more than 1000 USD for her total token values in Coinbase;
* Proofs of specific token holding, e.g., Alice holds more than 2 ETH in Binance;
* Proofs of nationality, e.g., Alice is a verified bank user with her nationality of British. 
* Proofs of a heavy gamer, e.g., Bob plays more than 10 hours per day on Steam games.

## For Developers

PADO team creates a template-based SDK (in progress) for developers to build their own applications by using PADO's off-chain attestation capabilities. The SDK will encapsulate the details of underlying cryptographic algorithms and protocols, and provide high-level interfaces for application developers to manage the data retrieval and data computation. Developers can leverage the SDK in two aspects:
* Developers can use the data source templates to integrate with various Internet data sources of their own interest, and to attest the corresponding type of data.
* Developers can define and implement their own application logic by integrating with data consumption templates.  

## Networks
Note PADO is deployed on Linea, and integrated with [Verax](https://github.com/Consensys/verax-documentation), which is the public attestation registry to store and manage the attestation data which can be accessed by any party. PADO users can submit these data proofs to Linea via Verax, which can be further accessed by other dApps. The following contract address is the PADO portal contract.


| Network        | Contract address
